# banking_marketing_campaign
This project is an analysis of a bank's marketing campaign, focusing on customer data to uncover valuable insights. The dataset includes information about customers such as their demographic details (age, job, marital status, education), financial behavior (balance, loan status), and the results of the bank's marketing campaign (contact type, campaign outcomes, subscription to the bank's product).

The main objectives of the project are:

1 - Customer Demographics Analysis: To understand the distribution of customers across different demographic groups (e.g., age, marital status, education level), and to assess factors such as average age within each education group or the distribution of marital statuses.

2 - Loan and Balance Correlation: To investigate the relationship between customers' loan status and their account balances. This helps to identify any significant patterns, such as whether customers with loans tend to have higher or lower balances.

3 - Campaign Effectiveness: To evaluate how successful the marketing campaign was by analyzing contact methods and previous campaign outcomes. For example, measuring the conversion rate of customers who were contacted and whether previous marketing outcomes influenced the success of the campaign.

4 - Seasonal Trends: To explore whether certain months show better campaign performance. This could help the bank optimize future marketing strategies based on seasonal trends.

5 - Churn Analysis: To examine customer churnâ€”whether certain factors like job type, marital status, or financial behavior (such as account balance or loan status) contribute to customers not subscribing to the bank's products.

By using SQL queries, we aim to extract meaningful insights from this customer data to inform decisions on how to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
